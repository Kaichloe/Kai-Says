# Kai-Says

 Kai-Says is a take on the classic game Simon Says with extra twist and turns!

## About
  Kai-Says will utilize sound and color to display the sequence that the player must remember. The player must then relay the sequence back. If they are incorrect they will have to start all over again. If they are correct they move on to the next level with the sequence length increasing. This will repeat until they player wins or the game wins!
